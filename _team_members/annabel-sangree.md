Annabel obtained her BA in Biology from Hamilton College in 2018. After graduating, she worked as a research associate at the Broad Institute in the Genetic Perturbation Platform where she optimized CRISPR tools for large scale screens. Annabel became interested in neuroepigenetics through her work studying how mutations in histone H3.3 perturb neurodevelopment. In the Korb lab, she is interested in studying the dynamics of histone variants in the brain. Outside of lab you can find her running, hiking with her dog Cooper, and tending to her sourdough starter.
