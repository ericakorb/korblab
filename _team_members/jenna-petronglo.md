Jenna Petronglo received her B.S. in Biological Sciences from Fordham University in 2014. After graduating, she worked as a research assistant at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine where she gained experience in neuroscience research. She joined the Interdisciplinary Graduate Program at Vanderbilt University in 2017 and completed her Ph.D. under the mentorship of Dr. Jim Cassat in 2023. Her dissertation interrogated how inflammation from the host response to Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis (bone infection) influences the bone-resorbing osteoclast to promote bone loss and damage. As a postdoc in the Korb lab, Jenna is excited to apply her immunology background toward studying how epigenetic regulators drive neurological disease. Outside of the lab, she enjoys live music, playing the piano, and getting lost in a great book.
