Annastelle is a PhD student in the CAMB Genetics and Epigenetics program and a T32 trainee. She received her B.S. in Biology and M.S. in Cell and Molecular Biology from American University, where she was also a NASA DCSGC summer research fellow. In the Korb lab, Annastelle hopes to contribute to the understanding of basic mechanisms underlying neuronal chromatin regulation and their implications in emerging neurodevelopmental disorders. When not at the bench, she enjoys doing the daily "-dle" games (Wordle, Worldle, Tradle, Nerdle), listening to music, playing pool and board games with friends, and eating Spread bagels by the Schuylkill.
