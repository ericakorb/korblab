Audrey received her B.A. in Biology from the University of Rochester in 2019, where she studied cancer avoidance mechanisms of long-lived rodents in the labs of Vera Gorbunova and Sina Ghaemmaghami. She completed her Ph.D. in the de Lange lab at Rockefeller University in 2025, where she studied mechanisms of telomere protection by the shelterin complex. In the Korb lab, Audrey is primarily interested in the epigenetic mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. Outside of the lab, Audrey enjoys science communication, fiction writing, cycling, yoga, and being in nature.
