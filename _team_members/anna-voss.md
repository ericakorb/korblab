Anna is a PhD student in the Neuroscience Graduate Group. She graduated from Emory University in 2022 with a B.S. in Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology and a minor in statistics. While at Emory, Anna worked in the lab of Dr. Steven Sloan where she studied neuronally secreted ligands that influence astrocyte development. In the Korb Lab, Anna is interested in studying the influence of histone variants and epigenetic modifications on glial cells and how these factors can impact neuropsychiatric disorders. Outside of lab, Anna loves to row on the Schuylkill River, go record shopping, and watch stand-up comedy.
