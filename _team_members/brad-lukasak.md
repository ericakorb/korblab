Brad received his B.S. in chemistry in 2016 from the University of Pittsburgh. While there, he worked in the lab of Alex Deiters where he studied conditional activation of small molecules. He was named a Beckman Scholar for this work. He obtained his PhD from Princeton University in the lab of Tom Muir. Over his six years in Princeton, he studied histone serotonylation, characterizing the enzymatic activity of TGM2 using a suite of biochemical methods. In the Korb lab, Brad’s interest in epigenetics continues, shifting his focus to the field of neuroepigenetics. He is particularly interested in using these technologies to understand the molecular basis of behavior and memory. Outside of the lab, Brad’s interest includes watching sports, playing videogames, running, grilling, and spending time with his nieces/nephews.
