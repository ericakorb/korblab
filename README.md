### Publications

It's not great that there's HTML for the bolding of Erica's name in the header material of each publication, but this exists because Liquid templates render content inside paragraph tags, which messes up the formatting. As a solution, I made an "authors" property that's rendered as-is, so I can control the formatting of each publication. However, the hack seems worth it to maintain consistency of formatting in citations.

Maybe someday I'll figure out a better solution for this...someday...

Use the special character `&#58;` to represent colons in titles
